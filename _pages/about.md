I am Roberta and I'm an astrophysicist who tries to understand black holes with the help of deep learning. I am a M.Sc. student from Black Hole Group at SÃ£o Paulo University. I have a B.Sc. in Physics in the same University. I speak Python mostly but I do have some crush on C, C++, R and Java. Keras and Tensorflow are my daily friends and I spend most of my time building and training models of deep learning. Black Holes are the most amazing objects in the Universe and my main research topic.

Personal information
======
I am a huge fan of Taylor Swift since 2012 and when I'm not working on something around deep learning I'll probably be talking about Taylor Swift or watching her videos, Taylor Swift's songs are what I listen when I am coding so, yes, I spend 24hr listening, talking or watching Taylor Swift.
